This challenge uses climate analysis for Honolulu, Hawaii to help plan a trip.  Python and SQLAlchemy are used to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database: Resources/hawaii.sqlite. See the climate_starter.ipynb, DailyPrecipBar.png and DailyTempBar.png to see the completed analysis and data exploration. Then, a Flask API was created based on the queries developed in the analysis. See app.py.
